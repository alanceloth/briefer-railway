Briefer's cloud version is the quickest and easiest way to get started with Briefer.

**To create an account, [click here](https://app.briefer.cloud/auth/signup).**

After signing up in using your email or Google account, you'll be prompted to create a new workspace. Then, you will be able to connect a data source, invite your teammates, and create notebooks and dashboards.

<Info>
  If someone has already invited your email to a workspace, you'll be taken to
  that workspace.
  <br /> If you still want to create a new workspace, click the workspace name on
  the top left and then "Create a new workspace".
</Info>

## Connecting a data source

After creating your workspace, we recommend that you add a data source so you have relevant data that you can use.

To connect a data source, open the "Data Sources" menu on the bottom left corner. Then, click "Add data source", select your data source type, and complete the form.

For more information see the [data sources docs](/product/data-sources).

## Inviting teammates

You can invite teammates to your workspace by accessing the "Users" menu on the bottom left and then clicking "Add user".

After you invite someone, they will receive an email to create an account and access your workspace.

For more details about invitations and permissions, see the [user management docs](/settings/user-management)
