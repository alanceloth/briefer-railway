Every page within Briefer has its own settings that you can configure to customize its behavior. To access a page's settings, click on the three dots menu on the top right corner of the editor and select "Page Settings".

This page includes an overview of the settings you can configure for a page.

<Info>We're working to add more page-specific settings soon.</Info>

## Auto-run pending blocks (cloud and enterprise)

Everytime your Briefer environment restarts, it will discard the in-memory state of your notebooks.

Therefore, Briefer automatically tries to run blcoks before the one you're currently running. That way, we can regenerate the state of previous variables.

If you don't want this behavior, you can disable it by toggling the "Auto-run pending blocks" switch to off.
