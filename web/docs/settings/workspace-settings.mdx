You can configure your workspace settings to customize your Briefer experience.

Right now, there are only a few settings available, but we're working on adding more. Here's what you can do:

- Change your workspace's name
- Allow anyone whose email belongs to your organization's domain to join your workspace automatically
- Change the default assistant model (only available on the cloud)
- Add an OpenAI API key (only necessary on the open-source version)
