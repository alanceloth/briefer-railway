Every time a scheduled page runs, Briefer takes a snapshot of the page's content and saves it. This allows you to see how your pages evolved over time and restore them to a previous state if needed.

<Warning>Snapshots are not available in Briefer's open-source version.</Warning>

To see a page's snapshots, click on the three dots menu on the top right corner of the editor and select "Snapshots".

This button will open the snapshots panel, where you can see all the snapshots of the page, including the date and time they were taken.

## Restoring a snapshot

To restore a snapshot, click on the desired snapshot in the snapshots panel. This will open a preview of the snapshot, where you can see the page's content at that point in time.

Then, click on the "Restore" link on the top banner of the snapshot preview. This will restore the page to the state it was in when the snapshot was taken.
