There are two ways to run Briefer's open-source version on your machine. The first is to use `pip` and the second is to run Briefer's Docker container directly.

## Running through `pip`

The recommended way to run Briefer locally is to install it using `pip` and run it using the `briefer` command.

<Note>
  Please note that Briefer requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to run, so
  make sure you have it installed before running the commands below.
</Note>

```bash
# Install Briefer
pip install briefer

# Run Briefer and access it on http://localhost:3000
briefer
```

If you run Briefer using `pip`, our initialization scripts will take care of downloading [our docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/briefercloud/briefer), setting up volumes to store Briefer's data, and starting the application.

## Running with docker

Alternatively, you can also run Briefer using Docker directly:

```bash
# Run Briefer using Docker
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v briefer_psql_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -v briefer_jupyter_data:/home/jupyteruser \
  -v briefer_briefer_data:/home/briefer \
  briefercloud/briefer
```

When running on Windows' PowerShell, it might be necessary to add an extra `` ` `` to the end of each line instead of the `\`, like this:

```bash
# Run Briefer using Docker
docker run -d `
  -p 3000:3000 `
  -v briefer_psql_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data `
  -v briefer_jupyter_data:/home/jupyteruser `
  -v briefer_briefer_data:/home/briefer `
  briefercloud/briefer
```

These volumes are for Briefer to store its data, including its pages, dashboards, schedules, and users. If you want to remove Briefer's data, you can remove these volumes.

## Deploying Briefer for your team

The ideal way to use Briefer is to deploy it somewhere your whole team can access.
