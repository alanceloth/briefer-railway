In Briefer, there are many ways to share your pages with others. You can share them through a public link, invite others to your workspace and send them a private link, or you can export your page as a PDF if you're on a paid plan.

Alternatively, you can also export individual plots as PNG images or download query results and dataframes as CSV files.

## Sharing a page through a private link (inviting others to your workspace)

To share a page through a private link, you must invite the person you want to share the page with to your workspace. To learn how to do this, please check the [user management](/settings/user-management) documentation.

After inviting the person to your workspace, you can share the page with them by clicking on the share button on the top right corner of the editor.

## Sharing a page through a public link

To share a page through a public link, click on the share button on the top right corner of the editor. Then, toggle the public page switch to "on".

Finally, copy the public link and share it with others. **Anyone with the link will be able to view the page**.

## Exporting a page as a PDF

You can export both notebooks and dashboards as PDFs. To do this, click on "Share" button on the top right corner of the editor and select "Export as PDF".

<Note>Exporting pages as PDFs is only available in Briefer's paid plans.</Note>

## Exporting a plot as a PNG image

Whenever you create an image plot with Python or with the "Visualizations" block, you can export it as a PNG image. To do this, click on the `PNG` button on the bottom right corner of your block.

## Exporting query results and dataframes as a CSV file

All query results can be downloaded as CSV files. To do this, click on the `CSV` button on the bottom right corner of your query block.

<Tip>If you want to download a dataframe as a CSV file, you can do a `SELECT *` using DuckDB in a SQL block and then click on the `CSV` button on the bottom right corner of the block.</Tip>

## Exporting other files

If you want to export any other type of file, you can just write it to disk using Python's built-in functions.

Then, open the files panel, find the file you want to export, and click on the `Download` button.

<Note>For more information about files and the files panel, check out the [files](/product/files) documentation.</Note>
