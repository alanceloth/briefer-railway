The best way to collaborate with others in Briefer is by inviting them to your workspace. This way, you can content with them and work together on the same pages.

You can invite your team by clicking on the "Users" menu on the bottom left corner of the interface. Then, click the "Add user" button on the top right corner of the users list to invite a new user.

<Tip>On the cloud version of Briefer, you can also allow any users whose email belongs to your organization's domain to join your workspace. To do that, go into the "Settings" page and enable the "Allow anyone @yourdomain.com to join" switch. Any users joining directly because of their email's domain will be assigned the "viewer" role.</Tip>

## Permissions

Briefer users can have one of the following roles:

- **Viewer**: Viewers can see all the pages in the workspace and can click "run all" to refresh the pages. They _cannot_ edit pages or create new ones.
- **Editor**: Editors can view and edit all the pages in the workspace. They can also run individual blocks, create and publish new pages.
- **Admin**: Admins can do everything editors can, plus manage users and workspace settings.

To change a user's role, click on the three dots menu next to their row within the users list and select the desired role.

## Removing users

To remove a user from your workspace, click on the three dots menu next to their row within the users list and select "Remove".
