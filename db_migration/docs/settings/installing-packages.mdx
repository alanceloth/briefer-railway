You can install new Python packages into your Briefer environment to extend its functionality.

To install a package, add a Python block to your page and run a `!pip install` command, like this:

```python
!pip install your_package
```

After running the command, we recommend that you restart your environment clicking the "restart" icon next to the environment's status on the bottom bar of the editor.

Any packages that you install will be available in your environment permanently until you uninstall them.
